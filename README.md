## Objective

The goal is to analyze disease trends in Kyrgyzstan using a dataset of reported cases. This involves cleaning the data, performing statistical analyses, clustering disease patterns, and developing a dashboard for interactive exploration.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on reported disease cases in Kyrgyzstan. It was cleaned to ensure accuracy before analysis.

## Methodology

### Data Preparation

- **Cleaning**: The dataset was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and ensure accuracy.
- **Overview**: Initial examination of the dataset to understand its structure and content.

### Statistical Analysis

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Used to understand the distribution of disease cases.
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, boxplots, and yearly trend graphs were created to visualize data patterns.
- **Distributions**: Normal and Poisson distributions were analyzed.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Used to identify relationships between different diseases.

### Clustering

- **K-Means Clustering**: Applied to group diseases based on reported patterns.
- **Cluster Evaluation**: Inertia and silhouette scores were used to assess clustering quality and separation.
- **Insights**: Clustering revealed meaningful groups of diseases with similar trends, providing valuable insights into prevalent health issues.

### Dashboard Development

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed using Dash to allow users to explore disease clusters and trends visually.
- **Accessibility**: The dashboard enhances understanding by providing an interactive interface to analyze complex health data.

## Results

- **Disease Trends**: Yearly trends and changing patterns over time were discovered.
- **Clustering Insights**: Distinct disease clusters were identified, providing insights into prevalent health issues.

## Conclusion

The project successfully analyzed disease trends in Kyrgyzstan, revealing important patterns and clusters. The interactive dashboard allows for an accessible exploration of the findings, potentially contributing to addressing health challenges in the region.

## Future Work

- **Additional Data**: Incorporating more data sources to enhance analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developing models to predict disease outbreaks.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Experimenting with more sophisticated statistical and machine learning techniques.
